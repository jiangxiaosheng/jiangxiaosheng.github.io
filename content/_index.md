### About me
I'm Sheng Jiang, currently on a gap year as I prepare to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science starting in the fall of 2024. I received my M.S. degree in CS from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) in 2023, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). I earned my B.Eng. degree in CS from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) in 2021. In addition, I've been a research assistant at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) since May 2023, working with [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/).

My research interests encompass the field of computer systems, with a specific focus on the following areas:
- Operating System: Memory subsystem, networking and storage stack, CXL, eBPF
- New hardware for storage system: Resource disaggregation, Zoned storage, RDMA, SmartNIC
- Systems for ML: Storage pipeline for data preprocessing, ML application scheduling/scaling
