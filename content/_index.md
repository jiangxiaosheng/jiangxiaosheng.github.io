<!-- Hi there! I'm Sheng Jiang, currently an M.S. student in computer science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). I received my B.S. in computer science degree from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).   
I love doing system-level programming and building robust, performant, and large-scale software systems. I'm now doing research on storage systems, advised by [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). -->

### About me
I'm a PhD student in ECE at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [George Amvrosiadis](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/). I'm also a member of the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml).

I worked on disaggregated NVMe storage with [Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) during 2023 to 2024. Before that, I received my M.S. degree in CS from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) in May 2023, where I was advised by [Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). I earned my B.Eng. degree in CS from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) in June 2021.

My research interests mainly include storage systems, networked systems, and distributed computing.

### News
- [08/2024] I started my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University.
