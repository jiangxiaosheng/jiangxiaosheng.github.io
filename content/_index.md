<!-- Hi there! I'm Sheng Jiang, currently an M.S. student in computer science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). I received my B.S. in computer science degree from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).   
I love doing system-level programming and building robust, performant, and large-scale software systems. I'm now doing research on storage systems, advised by [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). -->

### About me
I'm a research assistant working on disaggregated NVMe storage with [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).  I received my M.S. degree in CS from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) in May 2023, where I was honored to be advised by [Prof. Asaf Cidon](https://www.asafcidon.com/). I earned my B.Eng. degree in CS from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) in June 2021.

My research interests encompass the field of computer systems, with a specific focus on the following areas:
- Operating System: Memory subsystem, networking and storage stack, CXL, eBPF
- New hardware for storage system: Resource disaggregation, Zoned storage, RDMA, SmartNIC
- Systems for ML: Storage pipeline for data preprocessing, ML application scheduling/scaling
